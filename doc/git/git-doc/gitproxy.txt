Git works with git/ssh/http/https protocols and we need to use different ways to proxy them, which are summarized as below.

git

To proxy git running git protocol, we need

A working socks proxy server, and
BSD netcat as a helper utility. Please note that the so called traditional netcat doesn’t fit our need as there is not proxy support.
$ cat ~/bin/socks-gateway.sh
#!/bin/bash

METHOD="-X 5 -x proxy-prc.intel.com:1080"
/bin/nc $METHOD $*

$ export GIT_PROXY_COMMAND=~/bin/socks-gateway.sh

$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git

http/https

Git utilize curl to fetch data over http/https, so we can simply point the environment variable http_proxy or https_proxy to our proxy server and then it is all set.

$ export http_proxy=http://proxy-prc.intel.com:911
$ git clone http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git

$ export https_proxy=http://proxy-prc.intel.com:911
$ git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
